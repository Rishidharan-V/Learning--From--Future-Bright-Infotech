    <h1>Welcome to CNNS Based Agricultural analysis</h1>
    <p>I am Rishidharan, a final year Computer Science and Engineering student. Here you can see some of my Final year project CNNS Based Agricultural analysis </p>
     <h2>1: Abstract </h2>
   <p>This Project aims to develop an accurate measurement system using a hybrid approch that combaines <b>PHASE 3D AND HRNET.</b> By capturing three main still images (front,side,back) with a Webcam, key fruit landmark are detected and distances between points are calculated. </p>
   <h2>2:Introduction </h2>
    <P>The pupose of this project is to develop a highly accurate fruit measurementsystem that leverage state-of-the-art technology for keypoint detection and deep learning refinement</P>
